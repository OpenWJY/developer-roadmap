# Blockchain Structure

The blockchain gets its name from its underlying structure. The blockchain is organized as a series of “blocks” that are “chained” together.

Understanding blockchain security requires understanding how the blockchain is put together. This requires knowing what the blocks and chains of blockchain are and why they are designed the way that they are.

# 区块链结构

区块链的名称源于其底层结构。区块链被组织为一系列被“链”在一起的“块”。

要理解区块链的安全性，就需要理解区块链是如何组织的。这就需要知道区块链的“块”和“链”是什么，以及它们为什么要按照这样的方式设计。
